It is my hope that the vendor ultimately makes this code available in an official Git repository, so that projects can include it as a submodule.
Until then, this repository remains a verbatim copy of `vnproglib-1.1.5.0` from VectorNav, under its original MIT license (see [LICENSE.txt](<LICENSE.txt>) for details).
My only contribution is this brief README.
